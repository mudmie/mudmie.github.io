Specifically, the giant circle at the\n                center of the screen caught my attention.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"8\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"inspo.png\")}\n                    alt=\"Web UI by Ben Schade\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n              <p>\n                From there I imagined having that circle as a backdrop and\n                placing the boba logo on top of it. To further communicate my\n                ideas, I created a low-fidelity mocks to share and get feedback\n                from the design team members.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"10\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"lowfi.png\")}\n                    alt=\"Low-fidelity mocks for Hackioca\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n              <p>\n                During the shareout, the team came up with an idea to allow\n                users to customize their drinks. The users would be able to pick\n                the flavor of their drinks as well as the toppings. I then\n                worked with Vevina to plan the layout of the websites and the\n                graphic assets. Once the graphic assets were ready, I used them\n                to create the high-fidelity prototype of the landing page and\n                other sections of the website.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"8\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"boba-web.gif\")}\n                    alt=\"Landing page for desktop\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n              <p>\n                Since the landing page plays an important role in capturing\n                visitors’ attention, I wanted to make sure that the landing page\n                would give a great first impression of the website to the\n                visitors. Drink customization serves as a surprising interaction\n                that connects the users with the website. As the users change\n                the flavor of their drinks, the color of the background also\n                changes. Similarly, the floating topping also changes when the\n                users select a different one.\n              </p>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\n              <h3>Designing for Mobile </h3>\n              <p>\n                Due to smaller screen sizes, the user experience for mobile has\n                to be different than the user experience for the website. With\n                the size constraint, some adjustments need to be made for the\n                design of the landing page and drink customization features\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                First of all, I considered keeping all the elements, including\n                the boba hero, flavor options, topping options and floating\n                topping. Visitors would be able to scroll through option of\n                flavors and toppings to click the ones they wanted. However, I\n                found the screen to look quite busy and the interaction was\n                quite complex, which might discourage the visitors to interact\n                with the feature. I also considered removing the floating\n                toppings and rearranging the placement of the flavor and topping\n                options. Still, the screen still looked overwhelming.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"10\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"option1.png\")}\n                    alt=\"Option 1: customize boba on the landing page\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n              <p>\n                Since the first design wasn’t likely to work, I considered\n                placing a button under the boba hero so that the visitors could\n                customize their drinks on a different page. This design would\n                prevent the screen from being too busy and allow the toppings to\n                float on the screen. Yet, it was brought to my attention that\n                this design might require too many steps for the visitors to\n                customize their drinks, which would also likely discourage them\n                to interact with the feature.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"7\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"option2.png\")}\n                    alt=\"Option 2: customize boba from a separate page\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n              <p>\n                To make sure that the screen wouldn’t be too busy and the design\n                would require low effort for the visitors to interact with the\n                customization feature, I decided to hide the flavor and topping\n                options and remove the floating toppings. Instead, I added an\n                arrow on the left and right side of the boba hero so that the\n                visitors could click on them to select a different topping. They\n                were also able to tap on the boba hero to change the flavor of\n                the drink through animation for the circle backdrop of the hero\n                would have provided more affordance to the users.\n              </p>\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\n                <Col lg=\"8\" className=\"text-center\">\n                  <ImageBox\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"boba-mobile.gif\")}\n                    alt=\"Landing page for mobile\"\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </Container>\n      </ProjectLayout>\n    );\n  }\n\n  private getImageUrl(filename: string) {\n    return withPrefix(\n      `/images/${this.props.data.project.edges[0].node.imageFolder}/${filename}`\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query HackiocaQuery($path: String!) {\n    allProjects: allProjectsJson {\n      ...ProjectFields\n    }\n    project: allProjectsJson(filter: { url: { eq: $path } }) {\n      ...ProjectFields\n    }\n    mainImage: file(relativePath: { eq: \"hackioca/main.png\" }) {\n      ...MainImageSizes\n    }\n  }\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
