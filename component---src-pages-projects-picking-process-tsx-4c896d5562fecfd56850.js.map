I later used information from the user research\r\n                to create a user journey map. Eventually, this initiative led\r\n                the product team to review and redesign user workflow in the\r\n                picking process to help the forklift operators to work\r\n                efficiently.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>Problem Overview &amp; Background</h3>\r\n              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>\r\n                As forklift operators can pick up only one item at a time, they\r\n                can waste time travelling back and forth from production area to\r\n                warehouse area. How might we allow them to finish their task\r\n                quickly while also minimize potential error in the process?\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The warehouse picking process normally involves forklift\r\n                operators picking up items from one location and drop them off\r\n                at another location. Currently, the forklift operators can only\r\n                pick up one pallet at a time due to the restriction of the\r\n                software that Nulogy provides. This can slow down the picking\r\n                process as the forklift operators have to make multiple trips to\r\n                pick up items until they fulfill the picking list. To increase\r\n                efficiency to their workflow, I reviewed the shipping process\r\n                and designed a feature that would allow them to pick up multiple\r\n                items at once.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>User Research</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I began my design process by interviewing Nulogy’s professional\r\n                service consultants, who worked directly with the workers at the\r\n                manufacturing sites. After multiple rounds of interviews, I was\r\n                able to collect sufficient information to summarize a general\r\n                workflow of the forklift operators.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n                <Col lg=\"5\">\r\n                  <ImageBox\r\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"research2.jpg\")}\r\n                    alt=\"Collect information using sticky notes\"\r\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </Col>\r\n                <Col lg=\"5\">\r\n                  <ImageBox\r\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"research.jpg\")}\r\n                    alt=\"Whiteboard with research\"\r\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </Col>\r\n              </Row>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>User Journey Map — First Iteration</h3>\r\n              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>\r\n                Designing a user journey map was challenging as this was my\r\n                first time doing it.

In step 5 and 6 of the interfaces\r\n                below, the users have an option to pick up additional pallet(s)\r\n                or to drop off pallet(s) that they currently have on their\r\n                forklift.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n                <Col lg=\"11\">\r\n                  <ImageBox\r\n                    src={this.getImageUrl(\"interface.png\")}\r\n                    alt=\"New interface of picking process\"\r\n                    className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </Col>\r\n              </Row>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>Next Steps</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                While this problem seemed to be resolved by adding a feature\r\n                that allows forklift operators to pick up multiple pallets at a\r\n                time, there are other issues that need to be considered.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"What is the maximum number of pallets that can be picked at\r\n                    once?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />\r\n                This question was asked by the professional service consultants\r\n                when I presented them with this prototype. It’s good to allow\r\n                multiple pallets to be picked at once, but some limitation\r\n                should still exist to prevent any potential error. Still, the\r\n                maximum number can be varied, depending on the workflow of each\r\n                production site. Therefore, the product team needs to continue\r\n                researching whether to set a standard number or to allow the\r\n                number to be customized by each client.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"Can we redesign the entire picking process experience so\r\n                    that it’s more user-friendly?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />I see this feature as the first step to improve user\r\n                experience in picking process.
