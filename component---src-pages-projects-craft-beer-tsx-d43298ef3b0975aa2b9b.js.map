It distributes and\r\n                sells liquor throughout the province of Ontario in Canada. In\r\n                2016, an innovation lab, LCBO|next, was founded to design and\r\n                develop new technologies that will enhance LCBO's technology\r\n                initiatives.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>My Roles</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                As a UX/UI designer at the lab, I met with stakeholders to\r\n                discuss their problems and understand the user requirements and\r\n                constraints. I designed a web portal that allows LCBO retail\r\n                employees to place craft beer orders directly with brewers.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>Background</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Craft beer is usually produced by a small to medium size local\r\n                breweries. This makes it impossible for the breweries to supply\r\n                a sufficient amount of products to all LCBO warehouse at once.\r\n                As a result, each LCBO retail store needs to contact local\r\n                breweries directly to place orders and manage shipping\r\n                logistics.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>Problems</h3>\r\n              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>\r\n                With many factors such as promotion and seasonal items, it is\r\n                impossible for LCBO employees to order an accurate amount of\r\n                craft beer by just relying on their experience and gut feeling.\r\n                Without a reliable ordering system, the process will continue to\r\n                be time-consuming and prone to error.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                A store manager and a beer ambassador are responsible for\r\n                managing craft beer inventory and placing orders. Currently, the\r\n                inventory is tracked with a spreadsheet and calculated by hand.\r\n                To order the products, the employee needs to estimate the\r\n                quantity before making phone calls to each craft brewer to place\r\n                an order and arrange a delivery date. To modify, update or check\r\n                orders, the staff has to make more phone calls during the week.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                This current process doesn't only cause a burden to LCBO staff,\r\n                but also the craft brewers. Since there are about 660 LCBO\r\n                stores across Ontario, each brewer can receive hundreds of phone\r\n                calls during the week. In addition, the current process\r\n                restricts order modification to be made only through phone\r\n                calls. As a result, an unexpected quantity or products can show\r\n                up on the delivery day if the brewer forgets to update with the\r\n                store.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <h3>User Interview</h3>\r\n              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>\r\n                I know the problems the users face.
