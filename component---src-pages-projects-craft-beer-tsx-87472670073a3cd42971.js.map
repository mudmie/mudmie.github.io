There are about\r\n                660 LCBO across Ontario, so each brewer can receive\r\n                <i> hundreds of phone calls</i> on Monday and the following\r\n                days.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The current process restricts order modification to be made only\r\n                through phone calls. As a result,\r\n                <i> unexpected quantity or products </i> can show up on the\r\n                delivery day if the brewer forgets to update with the store.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>User Interview.</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Although I, as a designer, already understand the problems that\r\n                LCBO staff and craft brewers are facing, it's still valuable for\r\n                me to sit and chat with the users to ask questions and discover\r\n                what kind of system that they are looking for.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                From sessions, held to capture extra pieces of information from\r\n                LCBO store employees and craft brewers, I learnt that\r\n                <ul>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    LCBO employees looked for a system that would tell them\r\n                    exact number of product quantity needed to be ordered.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    LCBO staff would like to know an estimated delivery date\r\n                    from the craft brewers.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    After receiving orders from each LCBO store, craft brewers\r\n                    had to record order details to their system manually because\r\n                    LCBO didn't provide any platform for them to track the order\r\n                    history.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    Craft brewers needs an ability to modify orders as sometimes\r\n                    they couldn't keep up with production or they realized that\r\n                    the store ordered too many or too less.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    Both parties wanted to be able to communicate requests or\r\n                    updates through the system.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>Work Breakdown Structure.</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I use the Work Breakdown Structure to make sure that all\r\n                required components are included in the design.
