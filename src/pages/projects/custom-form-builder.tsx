                Users found concept #3 (Smart PDF) to be cool, but it didn't
                seem to solve their pain points. The concept still required PDF
                files to be created separately and the users also needed to
                manually draw each text field after uploading the PDF to
                PlanGrid. This concept would also require excessive development
                effort, making it the least feasible and desirable.
