              <p>
                Every year, Hack the North receives thousands of applications
                from students around the world. Based on the statistic from
                previous years, we expected to receive about 8,000 applications
                this year. The application portal is an important platform as
                everyone who wishes to attend Hack the North has to submit
                his/her application through the portal. Having a creative
                application process could provide an exciting and memorable user
                experience for those who wanted to participate.

              <h3>High-Level Planning</h3>
              <p>
                For 2019, we wanted to connect hackers together and promote
                diversity as well as a collaborative work environment. We
                arrived at the idea of allowing hackers to tell their stories
                and share them through the application process. Mapping this
                idea with the theme chosen by the team, we were looking to
                design a unique comic-themed application portal with
                illustrations that customized to their answers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The application portal would consist of five different parts,
                including creating a robogoose, filling out personal
                information, logging in or creating account, answering long
                questions, and viewing application status.

              <h3>Customize Your Goose</h3>
              <p>
                Since the Robogoose is the main character in the comic, the
                users will begin their application process by customizing the
                color and the accessory of their Robogoose.

              <p>
                If the users apply through their mobile devices, the
                customization process will be broken down into two steps due to
                the constraint from the smaller screen size. They will select
                the color first before clicking next to select the accessory.

              <h3>The Comic Section</h3>

                Once the users have customized their Robogoose, they will enter
                the comic creation process. In this step, the users will fill
                out their personal information such as their name, education
                information, traveling location and hackathon experience.

                For the education information, the users will provide their
                study level and graduation year. Here, the illustration of the
                comic background will change to the lockers, shelves with
                laptops and books, the office based on the usersâ€™ response
                whether their study level is high school, undergraduate or
                graduate.

              </Row>

                Next, the users will provide the name of the school that they
                are currently attending as well as their study program. If the
                users attend one of the seven schools that has the highest Hack
                the North participation rate, the illustration in this comic
                panel will also change to the iconic building of their school.

                For the traveling location, the users will let Hack the North
                know from which city they will be traveling to the event. The
                map will zoom into the city that they enter.

                Finally, the users will answer whether they have been to a
                hackathon before. If this will be their first Hackathon, they
                will get the illustration of the first time hacker badge. If
