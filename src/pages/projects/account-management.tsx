                The main goals of this project were to enhance the user
                experience for the Admin Console and to introduce a new workflow
                that allowed the IT Admins to set up organization ownership of
                user accounts.

              <h3>The Problems</h3>
              <p>
                The current system restricts IT Admins to only purchase licenses
                from a user log page. It also limits their capability to
                effectively monitor license usage as they are unable to access a
                list of projects that their users are working on.
              </p>
              {/* <p>
                The first problem occurs when IT Admins finds out they don’t
                have enough license when trying to add new users to the
                organization. The current process requires them to abandon their
                current task, navigate back to the user log page, purchase
                licenses, and repeat the process of adding new users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second problem happens when employees request for a license
                upgrade once they run out of sheet storage. Since the IT Admins
                have no information about projects that the employees are
                working on, it’s challenging to know if the extra storage is
                required for company work. It is possible that the employees use
                company license to work on their personal or freelance projects.
                As a result, the company has to unnecessarily pay extra to
                upgrade licenses for these employees.

                components: a license usage box and a table that displays a list
                of people involving in the company projects. The IT Admins can
                click "add license" button to buy more licenses and click "new

                {/* Since the current version of Admin Console didn’t comply with

                designs were completely changed to minimize future design work.
                For example, license options were listed vertically in the
                original design. Although there is no problem with this design
                at the moment, the list can get longer if PlanGrid offers more
                license options in the future. Given the scenario, a new design
                would be required to prevent the users from scrolling through an
                endless list. Therefore, I decided to replace the original
                design with a dropdown. This pattern works with the current list
                of license options and will also work if additional items are
                added to the list. */}

                Usability testing was run to observe how users interact with the
                system when they don’t have enough license to add new users to
                {/* the organization. Information gained from usability testing

              <p>
                The restriction to purchase license only from the user log page
                was one of the problems addressed at the beginning of project.
                In the design process, I thought it would be convenient if the
                users could purchase extra license without having to go back to
                the user log page. As a result, I added a helper text that says
                "if you don’t have enough license, you’ll be able to purchase
                more later" with a thought that the users would read it and know
                they can buy more license in after clicking next.

              </Row>
              <p>
                However, I was not entirely sure if the helper text would be
                effective enough. This thought led me to run a usability test
                with an assumption that the users would read the helper text and
                proceed to buy licenses. In the usability testing session, I
                gave participants scenarios, asked them to perform tasks,
                observed their interaction, and gave the rating of either easy,
                difficult, or fail. The table below shows testing results of
                three participants.
